2+^h|*WORK_PLAN*

h|*Description*
2+a|Top-level object of any logical work plan. References one or more `TASK_PLANs` that described the work, typically of each performer, although a single `TASK_PLAN` may also have multiple performers.

The attribute `_care_pathway_` and `_care_plan_`provide a way of associating a Work Plan with a published care pathway, and an operational care plan from within the EHR, if available.

|*care_pathway*: `link:/releases/RM/{rm_release}/data_structures.html#_item_structure_class[ITEM_STRUCTURE^]`
a|Identifier of care pathway etc, on which this Work Plan is based, if such exists. A 'care pathway' is understood here as a published standard for performing care for a major condition or presenting complaint, e.g. sepsis, heart attack etc.

The `ITEM_STRUCTURE` type is used to allow population at runtime with an archetype based on e.g. BibTex publication reference fields, such as the following:

* `title = "NICE Sepsis care pathway"`;
* `publisher = "National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (UK)"`;
* `year = 2016`;
* `url = "https://pathways.nice.org.uk/pathways/sepsis"`.
