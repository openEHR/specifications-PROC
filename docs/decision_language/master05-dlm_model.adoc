The packages are described below.

== Decision Logic Module Package

The module structure of a Decision Logic Module is formally represented by a class model consisting of minimal extensions to the BMM class (i.e. `BMM_CLASS`) concept. A DLM is thus understood as a special kind of module expressible as a constrained form of class definition, such that only certain types of features are allowed. It also has additions for documentary meta-data and terminology provided by the `AUTHORED_RESOURCE` class {openehr_resource}#_resource_package[from the openEHR BASE component^].

The meta-model is shown below, with the meta-class `DECISION_LOGIC_MODULE` being the root entity.

Within this model, the various DLM sections are modelled as specialisations of the BMM meta-class `BMM_FEATURE_GROUP`, so as to restrict the kind of features they may define. These are described in the following sub-sections.

=== Pre-conditions Section

The DLM `preconditions` section is formally represented as a feature group called `'preconditions'` whose members are limited to being a single `BMM_FUNCTION` containing the Boolean expression that appears in that section. The expression may reference only rules and input variables.

=== Reference Section

The DLM `reference` section is formally represented as a feature group called `'reference'` whose members are limited to BMM constants. 

=== Input Section

The DLM `input` section is formally represented as a feature group called `'input'` whose members are limited to BMM constants of a specific concrete type `TRACKED_VARIABLE<T>` and descendants, supplied by the `proc.decision_language.concrete` package.

=== Rules Section

The DLM `rules` section is formally represented as a feature group called `'rules'` whose members are limited to BMM functions. A specific meta-type `DLM_RULE` is used in case extensions to the standard `BMM_FUNCTION` are required.

== DLM Concrete Model

In order to supply a few of the key constructs of a DLM, a concrete model is provided with specific types that express the needed semantics. The main types required relate to input variables. The DLM concrete model UML is shown below.

=== Subject Variables

The variable definitions found in the `input` section of a DLM are designed to facilitate both intuitive DLM authoring and tracking of values over time from real data sources, typically health records, devices and so on. The generic class `STATE_VARIABLE<T>` and descendants provide a representation of a subject variable with a symbolic name. The generic type parameter is substituted with types used for representing atomic data values, including primitive types such as `String`, `Integer` etc, as well as types like `Terminology_code`, `Quantity` etc, as available in the  models (type definitions) _used_ by a DLM.

The class `STATE_VARIABLE<T>` models the simplest case: a variable that may be queried once for an execution run. This is sufficient for subject variables that are not time-dependent, and will not change during the execution, such as `date_of_birth`, `sex`, and Boolean variables such as `is_type1_diabetic`. The `_history_` attribute contains the variable value (normally only one sample), while the features `is_available()` and `unavailable_reason()` provide a way for missing data to be checked for.

For time-varying variables, the values must usually be tracked. The class `TRACKED_STATE_VARIABLE<T>` is is provided for this purpose, and adds the meta-attribute `_currency_`, a duration indicating the maximum age of the sample value to be useful or valid. The `_history_` attribute now contains variable samples over time. The function `value()` extracts the most recent available value, while `is_available()` is redefined to indicate whether a sufficiently recent value is available. 

Many tracked variables are quantitative, and for these, extra facilities are provided via the class `TRACKED_QUANTITATIVE_VARIABLE<T>`, which adds the ranges facility described earlier in <<_quantitative_tracked_variables>>.

Variable declarations in DL syntax, as described in the language section above are in fact instantiations of the `STATE_VARIABLE<T>` or a descendant, potentially with constructor paramaters supplied. Consider the following declaration, shown earlier:

[source,kotlin]
----
    systolic_blood_pressure: Quantity
        currency = 1 min,
        ranges["mm[Hg]"] =
            --------------------------------
            |≥180|:         [critical_high],
            |>140|:         [very_high],
            |>120|:         [high],
            |>90..≤120|:    [normal],
            |≤90|:          [low],
            |≤50|:          [critical_low]
            --------------------------------
        ;
----

If we were to rewrite this in a more standard programming language, it might look like the following object instantiation, preceded by setup code (the syntax 'Type_name (args)' is used to represent an object creation using a constructor call in each case):

[source,kotlin]
----
// build the ranges Map
ranges: Map <Terminology_code, Interval<Quantity> ();
ranges.put (Terminology_code("critical_high"), Interval<Quantity>(180 mm[Hg], Void);
    ...
ranges.put (Terminology_code("critical_low"), Interval<Quantity>(Void, 50 mm[Hg]);

// instantiate the tracked variable object
systolic_blood_pressure: TRACKED_QUANTITATIVE_VARIABLE<Quantity> (
    "systolic_blood_pressure",   // name
    "PT1M",                      // currency
    ranges                       // ranges
);
----

It will be appreciated that this is substantially more complex, and also arcane to a domain specialist. In the above, the part between the parentheses in the lower declaration corresponds to a call to a constructor of type `TRACKED_QUANTITATIVE_VARIABLE` with the signature `(name: String, currency: Iso8601_duration, ranges: Map<Terminology_code, Interval<T>)`. From a formal point of view, such an instantiation creates an instance that will remain for the life of the DLM's execution, in other words, a _computed constant_ value. It is thus a meta-instance of the BMM meta-type `BMM_CONSTANT`, as shown in the DLM model above.

Each `input` variable declaration creates an object similar to the above, which may then be used during the execution of the DLM by calls made from the functions in the `rules` section. The simplest possible 'bare' reference of the variable name alone, i.e. `systolic_blood_pressure` in the example above, makes use of the _default delegate_ feature of the BMM (`BMM_FUNCTION`) to invoke the `_value()_` function, avoiding the need to write `systolic_blood_pressure.value()`. However, all the features defined on `TRACKED_VARIABLE` and its descendants are indeed available for use in DLM code if needed. Thus, `systolic_blood_pressure.in_range([high])` is a normal call on the `systolic_blood_pressure` instance of `TRACKED_QUANTITATIVE_VARIABLE<Quantity>`.
