= Care Process Artefacts and their Formalisation

Various kinds of potentially formalisable artefact commonly used in healthcare are implied by the needs described earlier, including the following:

* _care pathway_: evidence-based plan of care for a complex condition;
* _clinical practice guideline (CPG)_: evidence-based protocol for a specific clinical task;
* _order set_: 'template' set of combined orders for tests, medications etc relating to a condition;
* _care plan_: descriptive plan for individual patient care, typically either oriented to in-patient care or post-discharge nursing care.

These artefacts do not constitute the totality of requirements of formal care process models, because they generally do not take into account the cognitive aspect of their use in care delivery by human professionals. The final inferences, decisions and actions of the latter will often use pathways and guidelines as a major input but only in the 'copilot' sense described above. 

Nevertheless, the formalisation of the semantics of these artefacts is a major part of the overall semantics of the languages described here. Accordingly, what these are considered to consist of within the openEHR process architecture, and how they interrelate is described below.

==  Best Practice Artefacts

=== Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs)

NOTE: in openEHR specifications, the term _guideline_ is used as a synonym for 'clinical practice guideline'.

A commonly cited definition of a guideline is (emphasis added):

* a systematically developed statement designed to assist health care professionals and patients make decisions about appropriate health care for _specific clinical circumstances_ ({cemb_oxford}[Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine^]).

A more recent version of this puts emphasis on the evidential basis:

* Clinical guidelines are statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options cite:[IOM_CPG_2011]

Guidelines are usually either:

* _therapeutic_, i.e. oriented to describing a procedure e.g. intubation; medication dosing and administration; and management of a specific condition e.g. asthma, or;
* _diagnostic_, such as for diagnosing various forms of angina.

Many diagnostic guidelines are relatively simple scores based on a number of patient variables, whose aim is to stratify risk into categories corresponding to type of intervention. Examples of guidelines include:

* {chad2ds2vasc_score}[CHA2DS2–VASc stroke risk score^];
* {nice_uk_stable_angina}[UK NICE Stable angina management guideline^];
* {acep_covid_19_severity_tool_pdf}[American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Covid19 Severity Classification tool^];
* Australian Clinical Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 2018 cite:[Afib_NHFA_CSANZ_2018].

==== Score-based Decision Support Guidelines

A very common kind of clinical guideline takes the form of a _score_, and consists of the following logical parts:

* an _input variable_ set;
* one or more _score functions_ of the input variables that generates a numeric value(s);
* one or more _stratification_ table(s) that convert score values to care classifications, e.g. 'refer to ICU' / 'monitor 24h' / 'send home'.

Although technically relatively simple, this kind of guideline can be very effective in changing clinical behaviour, primarily due to the fact that the score function and stratification table reflect the current evidence for the relevant condition. Such guidelines are usually executed in a single-shot fashion to generate recommendations for the clinician at the point of care. They are often visualised as a single form containing the input variables, the score and the resulting classification, with the input fields being populated from an EMR and/or manually fillable as required. 

The {openehr_cds_gdl2}[openEHR GDL2 language^] is used to represent this kind of guideline, and implementations typically show interactive forms such as the following.

[.text-center]
.GDL2 CHA2DS2–VASc stroke risk score
image::{images_uri}/cha2ds2vasc.png[id=cha2ds2vasc_gdl_form, align="center"]

Some hundreds of similar guidelines are available in the openEHR {gdl_models_github}[GDL2 Clinical Models Repository^].

=== Care Pathways

The notion of care pathway, also known by names such as 'integrated care pathway' (ICP) and 'critical care pathway', has various definitions in healthcare, such as summarised by the {e_p_a_care_pathways}[European Pathway Association (E-P-A)^] and many other authors and organisations. Based on these, we take a care pathway to be:

* a structured description of _complex care_ based on evidence, oriented to managing a particular primary condition;
* patient-centric (rather than institution- or procedure-centric) and therefore multi-disciplinary and cross-enterprise.

A care pathway is thus a higher-level entity aimed at achieving a _patient outcome_, whereas a guideline is aimed at performing a more specific professional task. Consequently, care pathways typically refer to one or more guidelines that describe in detail how to deal with specific situations within the management of the condition (citenp:[Schrijvers_et_al2012], citenp:[Vanhaecht_et_al2007]). Care pathway examples include:

* {nice_uk_pathways}[UK NICE Sepsis pathway^];
* {cancer_council_australia_breast}[Cancer Council Australia Breast cancer pathway^];
* {ihc_stroke_pathway}[Intermountain Healthcare Acute Stroke CPM^].

=== Order Sets

Within the above-described artefacts references to so-called _order sets_ may exist. An order set is understood as:

* a set of orders for diagnostic tests and/or medications and/or other therapies that are used together to achieve a particular clinical goal, e.g. the drugs for a particular chemotherapy regimen are often modelled as an order set;
* potentially a detailed plan for administration of the items in the order set, which may be a fully planned out schedule of single administrations on particular days and times;
* descriptive meta-data, including authors, history, evidence base, etc.

In most EHR/EMR sytems, the first item corresponds to a set of 'orders' or 'prescriptions', while the second is a candidate for representation as a formalised plan. 

In the openEHR process architecture, an order set is considered to be an artefact of the same general form as a CPG, oriented to closely related orderable activities. It is therefore treated as a specific sub-category of plan artefacts, whose initial actions consist of a _condition-specific set of orders_ with associated descriptive information. Administration actions may follow, within the same plan. Similarly to a care pathway or CPG, an order set may need to be modified for use with a real patient due to interactions or contra-indications, and any administration plan provided (perhaps as a template) may need to be copied and adapted for use in a larger patient-specific plan. Following this analysis, the question of formal representation of order sets is assumed to be solved via the same plan representation described for care pathways and CPGs.

=== Representation Challenges

Care pathways and guidelines are published based on studies performed on the available evidence base. This often occurs initially at a specific institution that is a recognised center of excellence for a condition (e.g. aortic dissection), or as the result of a wider research study focussed on a specific disease cohort (most rare diseases). Over time, successful guidelines and pathways find wider adoption and may migrate to a professional college or national institute for the long term. Regardless of the development history, there are a number of important issues that affect potential formalisation.

The first is the problem of _partial coverage_. There is  no guarantee that any particular condition will have a published care pathway or guidelines for all of its subordinate activities. Coverage is likely to be partial, or sometimes completely absent. Consequently, the definition of a pathway for a particular patient (type) may have to be undertaken locally by institutions and/or simply achieved by 'old school medicine'. This implies that some automatable patient plans will be developed manually rather than from any existing pathway template.

The second issue is the problem of _adaptation_, which can be divided into two sub-problems. The first is that each pathway or guideline is designed to address _one primary condition_ (sepsis, ARDS, angina etc) and will not generally be applicable unmodified to a real patient, due to patient specifics including co-morbidities, phenotypic specificities, current medications and patient needs and preferences. We might term this as a _merge_ problem since it is essentially a question of arriving at a safe pathway for an actual patient that accounts for all of the patient's current conditions (and therefore multiple applicable care pathways), medications and phenotypic specifics. Secondly, local practice factors such as formulary, local protocols, type of care setting (community clinic/hospital versus tertiary care centre/teaching hospital), availability and cost of imaging, drugs for rare conditions etc, will often constrain and/or modify any standard pathways or guidelines. We can understand this as a _localisation_ problem.

A third issue is the practical challenge of there being multiple guidelines and pathways _for the same purpose_ (i.e. diagnostic or therapeutic pathway), published by different institutions, including in different countries. Such guidelines may have been arrived at via different methods, evidence bases and may have variable coverage of the condition or procedure. They may also be expressed at differing levels of detail. We can think of this as a _competition_ problem. Generally, the competition problem will be solved organisationally, e.g. by the institutional clinical quality board / group making choices, or even synthesising 'best of breed' versions from the existing candidates for a given use.

Assuming that the competition problem is solved within the local context, the merge problem will still usually occur with the consequence that _more than one pathway may apply to a patient_, e.g. one for chronic care and one for an acute complaint. There may be conflicts between the pathways - commonly in medications recommendations - but also between the pathways and the other patient specificities. Well-written pathways and CPGs usually include obvious contra-indications for medications (e.g. being on anti-rejection medications post transplant conflicts with some chemotherapy drug classes), common phenotypic features (e.g. being female, being allergic to taxanes), and patient history (e.g. being pregnant). There is no guarantee that any given pathway or guideline covers all possible conflicts, hence manual _inspection, adjustment and customisation_ is almost always required. Localisation factors often means further modifications or constraints.

There currently appears to be little science on adaptation of guidelines, which means there is no obvious candidate method that might lead to automated or computer-aided adaptation. However communities such as the {guidelines_intl_network}[Guidelines International Network^] have working groups related to adaptation and localisation, which may lead to such methods in the future cite:[Kredo_et_al_2016].

For convenience, we term a care pathway- or guideline-like artefact for a specific patient, incorporating any necessary conflict resolution, merging and localisation, a _patient plan_.

With respect to the challenge of applying information technology to process-oriented care, key questions to do with published (natural language) pathways and guidelines are:

* the extent to which they are formally representable, including contra-indications and conflicts;
* how conflict, merge and localisation is solved to produce an automatable patient plan.

=== A Descriptive Model

We make a baseline assumption that guidelines and care pathways are essentially the same kind of entity in terms of structure, and are formalisable with the same model or language, with any differences (e.g. in goal or subject) handled by variable elements of the formalism. A survey of published pathways and guidelines shows that they consist of:

* _goal_ (pathway) or _purpose_ (guideline);
* _indications_, i.e. clinical pre-conditions for use;
* _plan_: structured natural language statements describing a plan, i.e. a struconsisting of _tasks_ (also known as _activities_), _decisions_ (understood as a special kind of task), and _wait conditions_ (enabling tasks to be situated in time or to be ready when certain events occur). Tasks and decisions  may be sequential or concurrent, and which may relate to:
** observations and assessments;
** orders or order sets;
** medication administration;
* _classification rules_ that convert a real-world value to a classification for the purpose of the guideline, e.g.:
** SpO2 of 88% -> 'critical' in a Covid19 assessment tool;
** Systolic pressure > 160 mm[Hg] -> 'high', in a hypertension guideline;
* _decision rules_, in the form of logical statements, flowcharts, and tables, defining the primary logic of the artefact, e.g. a risk classification for a patient based on N subject variables.

Formalising such a structure primarily involves finding sufficiently powerful language(s) for the plan and logic (i.e. rules) parts. Following the general principle of separation of concerns, we assume that the languages for plan representation and rules definition are likely to be distinct, and indeed that plan artefacts and rules/decision modules are preferably separate and related by reference. This enables decision logic to be developed governed independently of particular plans, and prevents bad practices such as clinically significant rules being hidden inside plan definitions (typically on decision nodes).  

Assuming this can be achieved, the second challenge then requires support within tools such that formal patient-level plans could be adapted in a fine-grained from existing pathways and CPGs and/or developed _de novo_ when needed.

== Care Plans

The care plan is a common artefact within clinical care, originating in nursing and relates to a specific patient rather than a condition. Definitions include {rn_central_care_plan}[a nursing-oriented definition from RN-central^] and one from the {iso_13940}[ISO Continuity of Care standard ('contsys')^]. From these we synthesise the following definition:

* _care plan_ - a dynamic, personalised plan, relating to one or more specified health issues, that describes patient objectives and goals, defining diagnoses and steps for resolution and monitoring.

Historically, a care plan has been a _description_ of intended care that may be followed by relevant staff e.g. home-visit nurses. A patient may have more than one care plan, and the contents of a care plan may be informed by one or more care pathways and/or CPGs, or might be 'standard local practice'. A care plan may even be _ad hoc_ in the case of a patient type with no well-described models of care available.

Within the openEHR process architecture, a care plan is considered a structured artefact whose contents are consumed by human actors, rather than being a directly automatable entity. It is assumed to include items such as:

* identifier and purpose;
* descriptive text;
* potentially references to CPG(s) or care pathway(s) that apply, with any necessary modifications;
* goals and targets;
* relevant problems and diagnoses;
* interventions: medication and other orders (and potentially order sets);
* monitoring criteria / instructions.

A care plan may be formalised in the sense that the referenced CPG(s) and/or care pathway are formalised as a personalised patient plan (per above).

== Formalisation

=== Conceptual Model of Guidelines

In the description of guidelines above, two of the key candidates for formal representation are plans and rules. Over some decades, the use of formal languages specifically designed for representing computable CPGs, often known as _computer interpretable guidelines (CIGs)_, including Arden, Asbru, EON, PRO__forma__ and others (summarised in citenp:[Sutton_taylor_earl_2006]) has shown that plans and rules indeed emerge as the two main components, and each consists of certain conceptual elements. Not all of these languages agree in all details, nor support all concepts equally well (temporal operators for example), however the common set of general features can be used to inform a conceptual basis and nomenclature for the formal elements of CIGs, which we take to be as follows:

* _plans_ consisting of:
** _tasks_, also known as _activities_;
** _decisions_, understood as a special kind of task;
** _wait conditions_, enabling tasks to be situated in time or to become ready when certain _events_ occur;
* _logic modules_ containing:
** _conditions_, i.e. simple Boolean-valued expressions referring to subject variables;
** _rules_, i.e. more complex computations generating results of any type (quantity, coded term, etc) codifying the main decision criteria described in a guideline;
* _subject proxy_, consisting of the set of _subject variable_ declarations relevant to the rest of the logic.

An architecture based on these precepts would of course have to solve the question of referencing from plans to logic modules and from both of those to the subject proxy variables, as well as the semantics of run-time loading, execution and much else. The above just establishes the basic conceptual vocabulary for such developments. The following diagram illustrates these conceptual elements.

[.text-center]
.Basic formalism concepts
image::{diagrams_uri}/simple_plan_rule_structure.svg[id=simple_plan_rule_structure, align="center"]

Some simple distinctions are thus made, for example that a _decision_ is a kind of _task_ (or activity) undertaken by a cognitive agent, whereas a _rule_ is an algorithm for computing the values on which basis decision pathways are taken.

One of the important assumptions made here is that all conditions, rules and other decision computations (e.g. Bayesian logic, calls to AI services) are _defined within logic modules, rather than being included within plans_, as is the common practice for example in the use of most workflow formalisms (BPEL, BPMN, etc). This is to ensure all computable criteria, no matter how trivial-seeming (e.g. the expression `systolic_blood_pressure >= 160`) are represented and documented in one place, and in a form that may be understood and maintained by the domain experts and guideline authors.

=== General Vision

The clinical artefacts described above may be classified as follows, for the purposes of potential computable representation:

* _automatable artefacts_: care pathways, guidelines, order set administration plans;
* _structured artefacts_: care plans.

Following the preceding section, automatable artefacts are assumed to consist of at least three kinds of element:

* _descriptive_: structured description, identification etc;
* _plan_: a representation of tasks, events and decision points (also known as _workflow_);
* _decision logic_: subject variable declarations and rules.

None of the above artefacts acts directly as an executable plan _for a specific subject_ (i.e. patient). Care pathways and guidelines each relate to a single isolated condition or procedure, whereas the general situation for a real patient is multiple conditions plus phenotypic specificities (e.g. allergies) plus current situation (e.g. being pregnant) plus non-clinical elements (e.g. patient preferences, type of health plan cover etc). Adaptation and merging is in general unavoidable.

Although there is no commonly recognised term for an patient-specific CIG, we assume its existence and term such an artefact a _patient plan_ for convenience, and make the assumption that for the purposes of formal representation it is a combination of:

* a care plan that describes the intended care approach (may be minimal in some circumstances, e.g. emergency);
* a potentially executable pathway of the same _formal representation_ as a care pathway or guideline, but whose content is adapted from relevant automatable CPGs and/or care pathways, where available.

Since a computable patient plan may originate from a full care pathway, such as for complex pregnancy, or a simple guideline, such as {chad2ds2vasc_score}[CHA2DS2–VASc^], it may express any level of clinical detail.

The various clinical artefacts described above and related computational entities, along with their relationships, can be visualised as follows.

[.text-center]
.Care management artefacts
image::{diagrams_uri}/artefact_relations.svg[id=care_mgt_artefact_relations, align="center"]

In the diagram, the term computer-interpretable guideline (CIG) is used to denote any formal representation of plan and related decision logic that could be executed by an appropriate engine. A CIG can thus be used to represent both condition-specific guidelines, care pathways as well as a patient plan. For the latter, it is assumed that the executable representation of a care plan may be included, where one exists.

Entities shown with dotted lines are not assumed to exist in all real world clinical situations. That is, care may be being provided for a patient for which no published care pathway is available, and only limited published guidelines. This would imply no or limited availability of condition-specific executable plans for use in constructing an executable patient plan. Nevertheless, the latter could be constructed _de novo_, rather than by adaptation of library pathways or guidelines.

=== Separation of Concerns

As implied by the analysis of citenp:[Rector_at_al_interfaces_2001], the formally represented pathways and guidelines shown on the right hand side of <<care_mgt_artefact_relations>> have important relationships with both terminologies and data sources such as the patient record. Some of the requirements described above - independence of guidelines from legacy HIS back-ends, and also the need for a high-level language of guideline authoring that enables 'smart' subject variables such as 'highest systolic pressure over previous 2 weeks' and 'oxygen saturation, no older than 1 hour', as well as functions of base variables, such as Body Mass Index (BMI, a function of height and weight), lead naturally to a greater separation of guidelines from information models of the back-end systems.

The general approach taken by the openEHR specifications is to treat smart subject variables as a first order concern termed here _data enrichment_. We also recognise a more contemporary view of patient record systems, devices and intermediate interoperability standards designed to retrieve data from such systems in a more homogenous way than in the original version of the Rector paper (from 2001). The conceptual view that results is shown below in a modified version of the original figure.

[.text-center]
.Models, interfaces and repositories with subject proxies, adapted from citenp:[Rector_at_al_interfaces_2001]
image::{diagrams_uri}/Rector_model_interfaces-openEHR.svg[id=rector_model_interfaces_openehr, align="center"]

In the above, a _subject proxy_ model is introduced that represents one or more subject variables, including basic measurable values (e.g. heart rate), functions of other values (e.g. BMI), and computed ranges (e.g. conversion of systolic pressure = 165 to 'very high' range), interval averages and so on. It is assumed that each guideline or pathway (or related collections) have their own specific set of subject variables. A subject proxy is therefore not a fixed global model like the older 'virtual medical record' notion, but instead a limited virtual view of the subject relevant to some guideline.
