= Preface

== Purpose

This specification of the openEHR Task Planning facility addresses requirements in the area of automated clinical process automation in which some form of granular planning of clinical work is required. The central concept is that of a _plan_ (or set of plans) designed to achieve a _goal_ and that relate to an _active subject_. Plans generally have related decision logic and require a means of extracting data from back-end systems concerning the subject. These other elements and their relationship to plans are described in the {openehr_proc_overview}#_conceptual_framework[openEHR Process and Planning Overview^].

The intended audience includes:

* Standards bodies producing health informatics standards;
* Academic groups using openEHR;
* The open source healthcare community;
* Solution vendors;
* Medical informaticians and clinicians interested in health information.
* Health data managers.

== Conformance

Conformance of a data or software artifact to an openEHR specification is determined by a formal test of that artifact against the relevant {openehr_its_component}[openEHR Implementation Technology Specification(s) (ITSs)^], such as an IDL interface or an XML-schema. Since ITSs are formal derivations from underlying models, ITS conformance indicates model conformance.
